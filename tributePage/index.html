        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>1977</strong> Born 6 weeks premature and given a 10% chance
            of living. I survive instead and grow so fat that I can’t roll onto
            my stomach. A muscular imbalance of the eyes makes me look in
            opposite directions, and my mother refers to me affectionately as
            “tuna fish.” So far so good.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1983</strong> Nearly fail kindergarten because I refuse to
            learn the alphabet. My teacher refuses to explain why I should learn
            it, opting instead for “I’m the teacher—that’s why.” I tell her
            that’s stupid and ask her to leave me alone so I can focus on
            drawing sharks. She sends me to the “bad table” instead and makes me
            eat a bar of soap. Disdain for authority begins.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1991</strong> My first job. Ah, the memories. I’m hired for
            minimum wage as the cleaner at an ice cream parlor and quickly
            realize that the big boss’s methods duplicate effort. I do it my
            way, finish in one hour instead of eight, and spend the rest of the
            time reading kung-fu magazines and practicing karate kicks outside.
            I am fired in a record three days, left with the parting comment,
            “Maybe someday you’ll understand the value of hard work.” It seems I
            still don’t.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1993</strong> I volunteer for a one-year exchange program in
            Japan, where people work themselves to death—a phenomenon called
            karooshi—and are said to want to be Shinto when born, Christian when
            married, and Buddhist when they die. I conclude that most people are
            really confused about life. One evening, intending to ask my host
            mother to wake me the next morning (okosu), I ask her to violently
            rape me (okasu). She is very confused.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1996</strong> I manage to slip undetected into Princeton,
            despite SAT scores 40% lower than the average and my high school
            admissions counselor telling me to be more “realistic.” I conclude
            I’m just not good at reality. I major in neuroscience and then
            switch to East Asian studies to avoid putting printer jacks on cat
            heads.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1997</strong> Millionaire time! I create an audiobook called
            How I Beat the Ivy League, use all my money from three summer jobs
            to manufacture 500 tapes, and proceed to sell exactly none. I will
            allow my mother to throw them out only in 2006, just nine years of
            denial later. Such is the joy of baseless overconfidence.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1998</strong> After four shot-putters kick a friend’s head
            in, I quit bouncing, the highestpaying job on campus, and develop a
            speed-reading seminar. I plaster campus with hundreds of god-awful
            neon green flyers that read, “triple your reading speed in 3 hours!”
            and prototypical Princeton students proceed to write “bullsh*t” on
            every single one. I sell 32 spots at $50 each for the 3-hour event,
            and $533 per hour convinces me that finding a market before
            designing a product is smarter than the reverse. Two months later,
            I’m bored to tears of speed-reading and close up shop. I hate
            services and need a product to ship.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>FALL 1998</strong> A huge thesis dispute and the acute fear
            of becoming an investment banker drive me to commit academic suicide
            and inform the registrar that I am quitting school until further
            notice. My dad is convinced that I’ll never go back, and I’m
            convinced that my life is over. My mom thinks it’s no big deal and
            that there is no need to be a drama queen.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>SPRING 1999</strong> In three months, I accept and quit jobs
            as a curriculum designer at Berlitz, the world’s largest publisher
            of foreign-language materials, and as an analyst at a three-person
            political asylum research firm. Naturally, I then fly to Taiwan to
            create a gym chain out of thin air and get shut down by Triads,
            Chinese mafia. I return to the U.S. defeated and decide to learn
            kickboxing, winning the national championship four weeks later with
            the ugliest and most unorthodox style ever witnessed.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>FAll 2000</strong> Confidence restored and thesis completely
            undone, I return to Princeton. My life does not end, and it seems
            the yearlong delay has worked out in my favor. Twenty-somethings now
            have David Koresh–like abilities. My friend sells a company for $450
            million, and I decide to head west to sunny California to make my
            billions. Despite the hottest job market in the history of the
            world, I manage to go jobless until three months after graduation,
            when I pull out my trump card and send one start-up CEO 32
            consecutive e-mails. He finally gives in and puts me in sales.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>SPRING 2001</strong> TrueSAN Networks has gone from a
            15-person nobody to the “number one privately held data storage
            company” (how is that measured?) with 150 employees (what are they
            all doing?). I am ordered by a newly appointed sales director to
            “start with A” in the phone book and dial for dollars. I ask him in
            the most tactful way possible why we are doing it like retards. He
            says, “Because I say so.” Not a good start.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>FALL 2001</strong> After a year of 12-hour days, I find out
            that I’m the second-lowest-paid person in the company aside from the
            receptionist. I resort to aggressively surfing the web full-time.
            One afternoon, having run out of obscene video clips to forward, I
            investigate how hard it would be to start a sports nutrition
            company. Turns out that you can outsource everything from
            manufacturing to ad design. Two weeks and $5,000 of credit card debt
            later, I have my first batch in production and a live website. Good
            thing, too, as I’m fired exactly one week later.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>2002-2003</strong> BrainQUICKEN LLC has taken off, and I’m
            now making more than $40K per month instead of $40K per year. The
            only problem is that I hate life and now work 12-hour-plus days 7
            days a week. Kinda painted myself into a corner. I take a one-week
            “vacation” to Florence, Italy, with my family and spend 10 hours a
            day in an Internet café freaking out. Sh*t balls. I begin teaching
            Princeton students how to build “successful” (i.e., profitable)
            companies.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Winter 2004</strong> The impossible happens and I’m
            approached by an infomercial production company and an Israeli
            conglomerate (huh?) interested in buying my baby BrainQUICKEN. I
            simplify, eliminate, and otherwise clean house to make myself
            expendable. Miraculously, BQ doesn’t fall apart, but both deals do.
            Back to Groundhog Day. Soon thereafter, both companies attempt to
            replicate my product and lose millions of dollars.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>June 2004</strong> I decide that, even if my company
            implodes, I need to escape before I go Howard Hughes. I turn
            everything upside down and—backpack in hand—go to JFK Airport in New
            York City, buying the first one-way ticket to Europe I can find. I
            land in London and intend to continue on to Spain for four weeks of
            recharging my batteries before returning to the salt mines. I start
            my relaxation by promptly having a nervous breakdown the first
            morning.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>2004–2005</strong>Four weeks turn into eight, and I decide
            to stay overseas indefinitely for a final exam in automation and
            experimental living, limiting e-mail to one hour each Monday
            morning. As soon as I remove myself as a bottleneck, profits
            increase 40%. What on earth do you do when you no longer have work
            as an excuse to be hyperactive and avoid the big questions? Be
            terrified and hold on to your ass with both hands, apparently.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>September 2006 </strong> return to the U.S. in an odd,
            Zen-like state after methodically destroying all of my assumptions
            about what can and cannot be done. “Drug Dealing for Fun and Profit”
            has evolved into a class on ideal lifestyle design. The new message
            is simple: I’ve seen the promised land, and there is good news. You
            can have it all.
